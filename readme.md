# yotZi
    - just a simple yahtzee clone in js. maybe i'll add a couple of cool features along the way but it's unlikely.

#### TODO:
    - score results
        - new scoring options rather than like yahtzee?
    - dedicated webpage and ui?
        - yotZi.poxeNe.com
    - RPG where you use roll/scoring results as attacks and damage values?
        - e.g. full-house casts a spell, "yahtzee" is a big critical hit, etc.

#### DONE:
    - ~~create random dice roller~~
    - ~~3 rolls, choose which dice to keep between each roll, return final results after 3rd roll~~
